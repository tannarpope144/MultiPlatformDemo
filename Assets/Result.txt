Last week, John talked about common barriers that get in the way of building a diverse team. This week, John teaches on the <em>benefits</em> of building a diverse team. There are so many leaders who would rather build a team of people who look, think, and act like themselves. But, building a diverse team will always take you further, make you better, and increase your reach. After John\u2019s lesson, Mark Cole and Chris Goede explore John\u2019s teaching together and offer some ways you can apply it to your own leadership. They also discuss the vital role diversity plays in creating powerful, positive impact in your organization and your community. <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the \u201cBuilding a Diverse Team Worksheet,\u201d which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John\u2019s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Diverse and clicking \u201cDownload the Bonus Resource.\u201d</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/5rl8ZjB4Rk0\">Watch this episode on YouTube!</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Leader-Shift--11-Essential-Changes-Every-Leader-Must-Embrace--Hardcover_p_2817.html\"> <em>Leadershift</em> by John C.
